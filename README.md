# Investigating_Road_Accident---Capstone_Project
This is a Capstone project, in which I have performed various classification algorithm to predict the severity of the accident whether the accident is severe or mild. 
Along with the project I am attaching powerpoint presentation (ppt) and report to get a better understanding of project. 
Dataset is also attached, which is inside the 'Data_Collisions.zip' folder.
